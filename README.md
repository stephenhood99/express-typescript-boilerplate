# Getting started

This was made with npm `9.4.2` and might not work for earlier or later major versions.

Run `npm install` to setup dependencies, then run the app with `npm run start`.

The app will run on `localhost:3000`, but the port can be changed in `index.ts` or by setting the `PORT` environment variable.

# What is this?
